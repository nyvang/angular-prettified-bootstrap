# angular-prettified-bootstrap
With a little help from AngularJS, Bootstraps grid system can be improved - synthetic, that is... Allow me to demonstrate

## Background
A while ago i had to create a new website for a client, and i went to LayoutIT and got a fast Bootstrap layout with the Bootstrap components that i needed. After taking the code to the editor, I came to think about all the <code>div</code>-tags and I found myself quite annoyed because, well actually they are not that beautiful to look at and moreover they definetly do not improve any readabillity - and therefore they scream of bad code/design.
There must be - maybe not better - but a more preatty way of doing this.

...and you know what?
      - I think there is

### Before
If you see the 'before-n-after-shots' folder, you´ll see the before.png contains something I refere to as <code>div</code>-tag-hell!
I´ve hidden most of the other stuff and maintained the <code>div</code> -tags so the file is as short as possible, and you can see all the tons of <code>div</code>s.<br />
Please note, that I´ve put in some extra Bootstrap components just to make it a little more dramatic :)

### Letting AngularJS work its magic...
So the steps is going to be the future commits, and when done, I might describe it here. 

### After
